#### **Question Requirements**

1. **Topics**:
   - **Algebra**:
     - Linear Equations
     - Quadratic Equations
   - **Geometry**:
     - Shapes and Angles
     - Perimeter and Area

2. **Difficulty Levels**:
   - Generate questions of varying difficulty:
     - **Easy (Level 0-1)**: Basic conceptual questions.
     - **Moderate (Level 2-3)**: Problem-solving requiring intermediate steps.
     - **Challenging (Level 4-5)**: Advanced questions requiring critical thinking or multi-step solutions.

3. **Question Format**:
   - **Multiple-choice**:
     - Provide 4 answer options.
     - Indicate the correct answer.
   - Include calculations or diagrams where applicable.
   - Use clear language and values appropriate for 11+ students.

4. **Example Questions**:
   - **Algebra (Linear Equations)**:
     - Question: Solve for \( x \): \( 3x + 4 = 19 \).
     - Options:
       1. \( x = 7 \) *(Correct Answer)*
       2. \( x = 6 \)
       3. \( x = 5 \)
       4. \( x = 8 \)
     - Explanation: Subtract 4 from both sides, then divide by 3 to find \( x = 7 \).

   - **Geometry (Perimeter and Area)**:
     - Question: What is the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm?
     - Options:
       1. \( 13 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
       2. \( 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
       3. \( 40 \, \text{cm}^2 \) *(Correct Answer)*
       4. \( 50 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
     - Explanation: Multiply length \( 8 \, \text{cm} \) by width \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) to get \( 40 \, \text{cm}^2 \).
