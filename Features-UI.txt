1
we want to introduce role based access controls and we want 4 roles - Student , Parent , Tutor and Administrator. Modify the application so that we can use role based access controls going forward for all the components

2
Can we now add the following feature - 
When the user clicks on "Practice Tests" present a screen with 3 options namely
 - Topic wise
 - Mixed
 - Mental Arithmetic

3
If the user now chooses topics then present a page with the list of topics with the sub-topics. 
Use the below as a list of the topics and sub-topics, they currently can be hardcoded but the list of topics will come from an API request in later versions.
Decimals - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Fractions - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Percentages - Increase , Decrease
Factors - LCM and HCF

4
Next lets add the following feature
Can we give an option to select the topic or a sub-topic ?
User can select multiple topics
If the topic is selected, the sub-topics are auto selected.
User can change or toggle the selections
User can select a topic, all the sub-topics are auto-selected, then the user can choose to de-select one or more of the sub-topics

5
Next we want avoid or reduce the amount of scrolling a user has to do to select topics and sub-topics
The number of topics and sub-topics might higher than what we have now  which means that in the current UI design the user will have to scroll quite a bit.
Can you provide an option which reduces this potential scrolling ?

6
Can we provide the option to select the topic from the left hand pane which has the list of topics instead of the "Select all" button ?

7
Now after the user has made the selection, lets provide a "Next" button instead of the existing "Start Practice" button.
The "Next" button must be on the top and not at the bottom 
When the user clicks the "Next" button they are presented with a page where they are required to select/answer 2 questions.
Question 1 - Number of questions which they need to respond with a drop down of values (hard-code to multiples of 5 upto 50) 
Question 2 - Timed/ Un-Timed - Make a selection
Also add a button which takes the user to page which shows all their selections and for the user to confirm. The confirmation Starts the Practice Test

Iteration 2 & 3
Need to highlight Topics for which not all the Sub-Topics are chosen in a different way to Topics for which All Sub-Topics are chosen. Also in the confirmation page need to concisely show the topics and sub-topics chosen in addition to the number of questions and timed or un-timed

8
Now on the user selecting "Start Test" present the following questions. For now we are hard coding the questions but in the later versions the questions will be provided or retrieved using an API
For each of the questions provide a space to enter the answer 
The questions are as follows

Here are the 10 questions formatted using mathematical notation:

1. \( 11.56 - 6.41 \)
2. \( 3.2 \times 0.8 \)
3. \( 7.5 \times 0.04 \)
4. \( \frac{4.56}{1.2} \)
5. \( \frac{0.75}{0.25} \)
6. \( \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{9} \)
7. \( \frac{3}{5} - \frac{1}{4} \)
8. \( \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{1}{4} \)
9. \( \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{3} \)
10. LCM of 12 and 18

These questions are now presented using appropriate mathematical symbols for clarity and precision.

9
Next when the user clicks on the "Mixed" option route directly to the page previously created with 2 questions - "Number of Questions" and "Timed/Un-Timed"

10
Next, when the user clicks on "Mental Arithmetic" button route to page where the user has to select the time - Provide drop down starting with 2 mins and increasing each interval by 2 mins 

11
a:
In the screen where questions are presented needs to be as follows
Left handside pane or panel with the questions numbers
Right hand side pane or panel with the actual question
User needs to be able to easily distinguish between questions 
 - which have been attempted/answered
 - Seen but Not attempted, skipped
 - Questions yet to be seen
 - Mark questions which need to be rechecked

Right hand side pane/panel has a question with ability to go forward or back

User can jump directly to any question by clicking the question number on the left pane / panel

b: how will the left panel of the test page look if there are 50 questions instead of the 10 ?
